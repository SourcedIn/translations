#Help us translate Codecademy for the world
### Hello world! Moi maailma! Bonjour le monde! Hola mundo!

Code is the 21st century global language, but the instructions still need to be translated. Join the translator community and help us spread the knowledge of coding all around the world. 

## Tools

Need some additional help but not sure where to turn for it? This page explains how the translations process at Codecademy works. 

You don’t need to have a formal training in translating or computer science, but we do ask that you are fluent in both languages you’re translating. 

Process in three steps

1. Choose a language you want to work on. Please put your translation into the appropriate subdirectory, using the ISO 639 and send a pull request. Be careful to use UTF-8 encoding in your files.

2. Mark the file your working on, the date you started and your contact details to the readme file. This way there is no duplicate work. 

3. After you’re done, take time to review other users translations. 


## FAQ


**Is there a style guide for translations?**

Here are some tips to get you started.
* Being accurate is important - coding is all about details. Translations are often case sensitive. Make sure you also translate the submission criteria tests. 
* We don’t want to be overly formal. Many of our users are beginners. Be friendly and approachable.
* Idioms, such as puns, jokes or culture-specific phrases should not be translated word for word. Look for an equivalent or similar expression. If no such equivalent can be found, translators should opt for the translation that readers will find the least confusing, even if it is less colorful than the original.

**How can I report bad translations?**

If you see a bad translation on the site, file an issue. 

**How can I browse courses in different languages?**

Go to http://www.codecademy.com/courses/lang/all and use the dropdown menu

**How can I communicate with the other translators?**

You’re allowed to work alone, in pairs and in groups; online and offline. We want to leave translators the freedom to organize and operate as they wish. Just let everyone know what you're working on in the readme file of your language. 

**What can I translate?**

For now, we’re only translating courses and the website. In the future there’s going to be other resources like support, glossary, guidebooks and campaigns to help localize.

**Do translators get paid?**

All translators are volunteers. However if you want to link your translation work to your CV/blog, it's totally ok. Be proud of your role in making Codecademy accessible for the whole world.
